    question: "Is Firebee Safe?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <span>
          Yes, Firebee is safe. Firebee meets the safety standards set by ICNIRP
          (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection).
          Firebee is
        </span>
        <span className="font-bold"> 3000x less powerful </span>
        <span>
          than your average smartphone. Firebee uses an ultra-low signal that is
          completely safe for home use. The technology behind Firebee has been
          rigorously safety tested and has over 300,000 hours tested by users
          for efficacy and safety.

    question: "How Does Firebee work?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <span>
          Firebee uses safe ultra-low energy magnetic signals to gently nudge
          you into a different mental state.
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>
          Every Firebee signal is made by studying real world magnetic
          signatures. Did you know caffeine has a unique one of a kind magnetic
          signature? Itâ€™s a relatively unknown fact that every molecule on earth
          actually has a unique magnetic signature.
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>
          Firebee using patented technology is able to take a magnetic signature
          and play it back through the Firebee headband. When you use the alert
          signal with Firebee you are actually playing back the magnetic
          signature of caffeine which our bodies already recognize.
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>
          Within minutes of feeling the ultra-low magnetic signal of caffeine
          our body begins to feel more alert and awake.
        </span>

        <br />
        <span>
          Firebee signal is 3000 times less powerful than a smartphone and
          completely safe to use.{" "}
